# AQUABC Changelog

All notable changes to the AQUABC model and Shiny frontend are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Cardinal Temperature Model with Inflection (CTMI, Rosso et al. 1993) replacing piecewise-exponential temperature response for phytoplankton growth
- Synthesizing Unit nutrient colimitation (Saito et al. 2008) replacing Liebig's Law of the Minimum for all phytoplankton groups
- Tunable Platt-style photoinhibition (BETA parameter) for light limitation in all phytoplankton groups
- Unified precision type definitions via `precision_kinds` module
- Compiler warning flags (`-Wall -Wextra`) for release and fast builds
- Comprehensive AQUABC model equations reference document (`AQUABC_Model_Equations.md`)

### Changed
- Bundled scalar constant arguments into derived types (`t_diatom_params`, `t_cyn_params`, `t_opa_params`, etc.) for 6 kinetics subroutines
- Bundled environmental input arrays into `t_phyto_env` derived type in 7 phytoplankton subroutines
- Replaced hardcoded dimension magic numbers with named constants throughout
- Replaced tabs with spaces in 15 source files for consistent formatting

### Security
- Added `safe_resolve()` path traversal protection to all Shiny app file operations (`load_file`, `save_file`, `file_info_panel`, `validate_constants_file`, observation handlers)
- Added subprocess timeouts (120s clean, 600s build) with `kill()` on timeout to prevent hung processes
- Added bounded output buffers to all subprocess stdout readers

### Added (Developer Tooling)
- `pyproject.toml` with ruff linter configuration (E, F, W, I, UP, B, S rules)
- 46 Python unit tests for parsers (`parameter_parser`, `ic_parser`, `options_parser`, `simulation_config`) and `safe_resolve`
- 19 Playwright integration tests covering app startup, navigation, and all major panels
- 9 Selenium integration tests (gracefully skip without chromedriver)
- CI `python-lint-test` job running ruff and pytest in parallel with Fortran build
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` with build/test/PR workflow documentation
- Makefile convenience targets: `make test-all`, `make test-python`, `make test-fortran`, `make lint`
- Fixed all 653 ruff lint warnings across `shiny_app/*.py` (whitespace, imports, type annotations, bare excepts)

### Fixed
- Guarded ~25 division-by-zero risks in sediment model (porosity, depth, mixing length, pH-to-H+ conversions)
- Guarded REDOX speciation divisions against zero/negative values in pelagic model
- Guarded CO2SYS critical divisions and discriminant
- Guarded macroalgae quota divisions against zero biomass
- Guarded state variable ratio divisions in pelagic model (Fe/Mn dissolved fractions)
- Added pH, temperature, and salinity clamping at model entry points
- Replaced raw `exp()` with `safe_exp()` in light limitation calculations to prevent overflow
- Numerical hardening: zooplankton switching, parameter validation, cyanobacteria cleanup
- Fixed 13 critical ecological model bugs across pelagic, sediment, and macroalgae
- Fixed Mn speciation, leap year, bathymetry initialization, and NaN guards
- Fixed settling suppression bug, allocation error checks, and getpar precision
- Added `implicit none` to all remaining subroutines and functions
- Removed 138 unused variable declarations across 25 source files
- Removed 5 unused parameter imports and declarations
- Resolved compare-reals and real-to-integer conversion warnings
- Initialized variables that may be used uninitialized
- Resolved character truncation warning in WRITE_PELAGIC_MODEL_CONSTANTS
- Fixed missing `precision_kinds` dependency in 6 test targets
- Removed ~250 lines of dead/commented-out code across 9 source files

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-22

### Added
- Pop-up tooltips throughout the entire interface for all major controls
- Changelog widget in the app header bar
- Output directory now saved/loaded with simulation configuration
- Two-column layout for output boxes selection
- CI integration with ftnchek static analysis for Fortran code quality
- Fortran unit tests for VECTOR_MATRIX_UTILS module

### Changed
- Build Options button moved inside Run Parameters card (cleaner layout)
- Output Directory moved from Simulation Config to Output Config tab
- Reduced vertical spacing in Run Parameters card for compactness
- Reduced text size in run log display
- Increased run log buffer from 50KB to 200KB
- Sediment Model disabled by default
- WCONST_04.txt set as visible default for Pelagic Constants File

### Fixed
- Intel Fortran (ifx) compiler linking with runtime libraries (-lifcore -lifport)
- Allelopathy kinetics: added missing concentration term for first-order degradation
- Allelopathy kinetics: initialize SEC_METAB state variables (33-36) before rate calculations
- Removed redeclaration of S_SEC_METAB_* variables to avoid module conflicts
