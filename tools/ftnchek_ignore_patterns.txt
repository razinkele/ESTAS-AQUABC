I do not yet support KIND selectors

allocatable ::
dimension(:)
# - generic "syntax error" messages adjacent to supported modern syntax
syntax error, unexpected identifier
syntax error, unexpected end of statement
# - allocations/expressions that ftnchek struggles with in modern F90
expression expected
syntax error, unexpected ('
# - Known file-level quirks
identifier MODULEALLELOPATHY has embedded space
