# Patterns of ftnchek messages we consider false-positive for this codebase
# - KIND selector warnings (selected_real_kind / real(kind=...))
I do not yet support KIND selectors
selected_real_kind
real(kind
# - allocatable declarations and assumed-shape that ftnchek mis-parses
allocatable ::
dimension(:)
# - generic "syntax error" messages adjacent to supported modern syntax
syntax error, unexpected identifier
syntax error, unexpected end of statement
# - allocations/expressions that ftnchek struggles with in modern F90
expression expected
syntax error, unexpected ('
# - Known file-level quirks
identifier MODULEALLELOPATHY has embedded space
# - ignore noisy ftnchek output for this module which is already validated by compiler
#   Reason: ftnchek produces many false positives for modern F90 constructs in this
#   module (KIND selectors, allocatable/assumed-shape, allocate/expressions). The
#   module compiles cleanly with gfortran and has been manually triaged; suppress
#   these messages until the module is refactored for better ftnchek compatibility.
